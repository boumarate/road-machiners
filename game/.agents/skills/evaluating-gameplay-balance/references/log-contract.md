# Gameplay Balance Log Contract

This schema is engine-neutral. A Godot, Unity, web, native, or custom simulation harness can use it as long as the values are comparable across runs.

Required top-level fields:

Policy expectations:

- `run_config` should make comparison conditions explicit: seeds, fixed-step timing or equivalent deterministic stepping, max duration, policy/search budget, public input schema, visible-state features available to policies, and policy visibility.
- `input_schema` should state each public control's type, range or valid values, neutral value when relevant, timing semantics, and simultaneous-input constraints when they matter.
- `policy_visibility` should list which visible-state features each policy may read. Hidden-state access must be labeled as an oracle-only upper-bound run.
- `monotonous.cases` should include idle/no-input and simple repeated-action policies relevant to the game.
- `exploratory.best` should come from random, heuristic, or search-based policies with multiple trials.
- Exploratory policies should use only public input and visible or player-inferable state unless explicitly labeled as an upper-bound oracle.
- `exploratory_ratio` is `exploratory.best.score / monotonous.max_score`.
- `policy_profiles` is optional for older reports but required before any difficulty, timer, pacing, or progression conclusion. Each non-baseline policy declares `oracle`, `precise`, or `human-limited`; `human-limited` entries record the parameter values used.
- `exploratory.best` and `exploratory_ratio` come from `precise` policies (search-based runners included, unless labeled `oracle`). Report `human-limited` outcomes under `profile_results` instead of mixing them into the ratio.
- When policies declare input kinds (for example `aimed`, `reactive`, `escape`; define kinds that fit the game's control scheme), `input_analysis` should count inputs per kind and `death_analysis` should break deaths down by `preceding_input_kind` and `since_last_input_ms`, so the sanity checks in `simulation-harness.md` can be computed from telemetry.
- Policies that estimate positions or hidden state may add belief-error samples (estimated versus true) under `input_analysis` or a policy-specific block.
- If `monotonous.max_score` is zero, report the ratio with an explicit convention and explain it in the analysis.
- Telemetry details may vary by engine, but preserve the four analysis perspectives.
- A report that only contains score, elapsed time, and `exploratory_ratio` is a summary, not enough for root-cause balance judgment.

Interpretation guide:

- `<= 1.0`: fail; monotonous play is optimal or tied.
- `1.0-1.5`: needs work; skill reflection is weak.
- `> 1.5`: pass as a detector, subject to experience guardrails.
